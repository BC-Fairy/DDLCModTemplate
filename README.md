# DDLCModTemplate
A template for producing Doki Doki Literature Club Mods that adhere to Team Salvato's guidelines

How to get started building a mod:

Download Renpy SDK.

Fork this git into a folder in Renpy's working directory.

Drop the .rpa files from DDLC into the /game directory.

Launch the project in Renpy, and it should compile and run.

Click Build Distributions in Renpy and select "DDLC Compatible Mod" This will make a cross-platform zip file with the files for the mod and installation instructions.

Don't Profit, because that breaks Team Salvato's IP Guidelines.
