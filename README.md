# DDLC Mod Template
Greetings! Welcome to the repository. Here, you can find a template for creating mods off of Doki Doki Literature Club. It contains a walkthrough of getting started with building a mod and the options you have for customization.

### Getting Started
Steps will be provided for setting up the template. If you're entirely new to this, feel free to play the game and learn the basics!

1. Download the Ren'Py SDK. (Simply googling it will bring up the website)
2. Extract the .ZIP file to a suitable directory of your choice. 
3. Download the repo & extract the .ZIP into the Ren'Py working directory (where you extracted Re.'Py)
4. Acquire the DDLC files (download it from the website) & drop the .rpa files from it into the /game directory.
5. Launch the project in Ren'Py. It should compile & run.
6. Navigate the Ren'Py menu & select "Build Distributions" & select "DDLC Compatible Mod." This will create a cross-platform .ZIP file with files for the mod & installation instructions.

### Template Features
1. Import save data from DDLC. This will *not* affect the original game.
2. Build Packaging. Distribute cross-platforms with ease thanks to Ren'Py.
3. Mod Installation instructions & guide. Run the game to get a tutorial by Monika!
4. Splash screen on first load. This adheres to the Team Salvato guidelines for creating fan mods of the game.
5. Customizable! Feel free to base your creations off of this template, as it serves to give you a starting point for any ideas you wish to create.
