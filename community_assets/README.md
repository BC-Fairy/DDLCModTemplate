# Community Assets

This directory contains assets (music, art, etc.) created by the community for use in other mods. Each folder contains the assets and a script file that adds those assets to the game. To install, simply place the folder with the desired assets in the mod_assets folder of your DDLC mod.

See the script files accompanying the files for more info and instructions for giving credit to asset creators.
